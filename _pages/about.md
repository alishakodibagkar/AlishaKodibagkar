I study the brain ðŸ§  and the voice ðŸ—£.

I am a M.S.E and B.S Graduate in Biomedical Engineering (2021) from Johns Hopkins University, and I work at the [Senseable Intelligence Group](https://sensein.group/) within the [Gabrieli Lab](https://gablab.mit.edu/) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. [Attached](https://gablab.mit.edu/team/kodibagkar-alisha/) is my profile.

I am broadly interested in applying computational approaches to neuroscience problems. My background is in computational medicine and neuroimaging analysis, and my current focus is in developing technologies to help those with communication disorders and investigating the neural mechanisms of speech.
