I study the brain ðŸ§  and the voice ðŸ—£.

I am a Technical Associate at the [Senseable Intelligence Group](https://sensein.group/) within the [Gabrieli Lab](https://gablab.mit.edu/) at the McGovern Institute of Brain Research at MIT, and I graduated from Johns Hopkins University with a B.S and M.S.E in Biomedical Engineering in 2021.

I am broadly interested in applying computational approaches to neuroscience problems. My background is in computational medicine and neuroimaging analysis, and my current focus is in developing technologies to help those with communication disorders and investigating the neural mechanisms of speech.
