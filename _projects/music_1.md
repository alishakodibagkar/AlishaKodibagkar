**Team Description:** Kranti is Johns Hopkins’ co-ed South Asian Fusion a cappella group that was established in 2003 with the goal of seamlessly blending both traditional and modern Indian musical forms with contemporary Western songs. The word “kranti,” in Hindi, means “revolution,” and to that end, we strive to present a unique vocal combination of the East and West in all of our songs.
