**Project Description:** The Brainlit project was focused on data science towards the [mouselight dataset](https://www.hhmi.org/news/mouselight-project-maps-1000-neurons-and-counting-in-the-mouse-brain), which contains neural wiring diagrams for over 1000 neurons in the mouse brain. The Brainlit tool has further extended towards data science on large data volumes developed by Neurodata at JHU.

**Lab:** Neurodata Lab at Johns Hopkins University

**Advisors:** Dr. Joshua Vogelstein, Tommy Athey (Ph.D. Candidate)

**Other project members:** Bijan Varjavand

**Role:** Software Development as Research Intern

**Personal Contribution:**
- Developed Neuron_trace.py, which represents neuron traces as Python objects for improves their handling, format conversion, and morphology analysis.
