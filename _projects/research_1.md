**Project Description:** The aim of this project is to explore assistive technologies to help increase fluency for people who stutter. Our studies investigate the use of Altered Auditory Feedback (AAF), a stuttering intervention in which an individualâ€™s speech is played back to them in an altered manner. 

**Lab:** Senseable Intelligence Group at Massachusetts Institute of Technology

**Advisors:** Dr. Satrajit Ghosh, Dr. Rebecca Kleinberger

**Other project members:** Dr. Akito van Troyer (Software development collaborator), Megha Vemuri (high school student)

**Role:** Project Management and Software Development as Technical Associate

**Study #1:**

**Study #2:** (upcoming)
  - Description: 1-month longitudinal study investigating the effects of altered auditory feedback modes, involves voice data collection and usage collection

**Personal Contribution:**
- iOS development using Objective-C for improved application features and database management (Firebase)
- Subject recruitment for preliminary study to gather user feedback and usage data for app.
- Application launch; achieved 105 downloads.
- Auto-updating online dashboard to display app usage.
- Current design and implementation of a month-long consented targeted longitudinal experiment to examine the effect of AAF for PWS in an ecological setting. 
- Presented to project catalysts at the Deshpande Center for Technological Innovation
- Further personal project goals:
  - In progress: Literature review on uses of auditory feedback
  - In progress: Processing voice recordings of stuttered speech gathered in the lab for automated detection of stuttering disfluencies
  - Fellowship proposal on using AAF to investigate the neural basis of sensory feedback in speech (submitted Oct 2022)
