**Project Description:** Although there is a rising prevalence of cannabis for medical use, It is unclear how Medical Marijuana (MM) affects the brain. Previous fMRI studies on cannabis use are mostly cross-sectional, consist of small sample sizes, and are not specific to study medical marijuana. The goal of this project is to understand the impact of Medical Marijuana Card (MMC) ownership on brain structure and function for people with pain, insomnia, and affective disorder symptoms. This project consists of analysis of previous collected task-based functional MRI data, resting-state functional MRI data, and structural MRI data.

**Lab:**  Senseable Intelligence Group at Massachusetts Institute of Technology

**Advisors:** Dr. Satrajit Ghosh, Dr. Jodi Gilman

**Other project members:** Debbie Burdinski (M.D/Ph.D. Candidate)

**Role:** Data Analysis as Technical Associate

**Personal Contribution:**
- Literature search on fMRI studies on cannabis use for hypothesis generation
- Analysis of task fMRI data using Nilearn program for the Stop Signal Task to study impulsivity
- Further project goals:
  - nalysis of structural, resting-state, and diffusion data from study
  - Machine learning prediction of controls versus cannabis groups based on multimodal data
