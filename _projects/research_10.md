**Project Description:**  The cat brain can serve as a model for research on congenital deafness, as cats are born deaf. However, there is a need for comparison of cat brain and human brain regions during analyses. For this project, I used images of a 2D cat brain atlas depicting brain regions as slices, and converted these images to a 3D model of the cat brain.

**Lab:** Center for Imaging Science (CIS) at Johns Hopkins University

**Advisors:** Dr. Tilak Ratnanather

**Role:** Summer Research Intern

**Personal Contribution:**
- Applied previously developed 3D image reconstruction scripts on Matlab to reconstruct a 3D model of the cat brain from a 2D atlas depicting brain regions as slices
