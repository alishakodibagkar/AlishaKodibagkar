**Project Description:**  A significant number of patients admitted to ICU for a non-neurological illness develop an encephalopathy characterized by decreased levels of responsiveness. This project aims to use features available on the first day of intensive care to predict responsiveness phenotype at the time of discharge from the ICU. Featues include physiological data and lab testing data. The eICU dataset is used for training and testing, and the MIMIC-IV dataset is used for external validation. Classifiers applied include adaptive boosting decision trees, Gaussian Na√Øve Bayes, logistic regression, extremely randomized trees, random forest, and gradient boosted decision trees. The AUROC is 0.86 for the entire sample patients, 0.84 for responsive admissions, and 0.79 for unresponsive admissions. Features strongly associated with unresponsiveness at discharge are higher heart rate, lower systemic blood pressure, higher blood urea nitrogen and higher red blood cell count.
