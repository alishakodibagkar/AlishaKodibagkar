**Project Description:** Marmosets are often used for behavior neuroscience research due to their ease of handling, quick reproduction, and sensorimotor system similar to larger primates and humans. Within a marmoset chair model, marmosets lick a feeding tube during the presentation of a target sound to receive a food reward. Through the chair model, marmosets can train for a Go/NoGo task, which requires them to lick a feeding tube when the correct stimulus is presented. Training marmosets in their home environment can free laboratory space and experimenter time and get rid of the need for animal transport. In addition, a 2AFC (two-alternative forced choice) task can reduce false alarm response compared to a Go/NoGo task, as subjects are forced to choose one of two options. Dr. Elias Issa at Columbia University has previously developed an iPad training tool for marmoset training. The goal of this project is to develop an in-cage iPad setup for marmoset training on 2AFC tasks.

**Lab:** Laboratory of Auditory Neurophysiology @ Johns Hopkins University 

**Advisors:** Dr. Xiaoqin Wang, Dr. John Hoon Lee

**Role:** Training and Tool Design as Research Intern

**Personal Contribution:**
- Background literature search on marmosets as a model for behavioral neuroscience study, the marmoset chair model for auditory behavior study, iPads as a behavioral training tool, psychophysics, and the Go/No-Go and 2AFC tasks to make choices under conditions of uncertainty.
- Training on marmoset handling and JavaScript programming language
- Design of iPad tool 
- Early development of iPad tool software
- Collaborated with Elias Issa at Columbia Univ. to understand implementation of method in other labs
