**Project Description:** Performing morphological analysis on neurons can reveal important information about neuron subpopulations. Individual neuron traces can be represented as points in 3D space organized as a tree structure. In order to study the morphology of axons represented as traces, the Neurodata lab is interested in characterizing main and collateral branches of axons. Previously, the lab has developed software to classify axon branches within these categories using the longest root-to-leaf paths within the axon. However, further study on accurate ways to characterize neuron branches is needed. In this work,manually traced axon trajectories are predicted based on branch angles. This project uses data from the Kolodkin Lab in the Johns Hopkins University Department of Neuroscience. The dataset includes 33 neuron traces containing 1 or more neurons from pyramidal cells in layer 2 and 3 of the mouse cortex. Each neuron trace has been further divided into individual paths, including the main axon and collateral branches through manual tracing. 

**Lab:** Neurodata Lab at Johns Hopkins University

**Advisors:**  Dr. Joshua Vogelstein, Tommy Athey (Ph.D. Candidate)

**Other project members:** MyCo Le (High School Student)

**Role:** Independent Project as Research Intern 

**Personal Contribution:**
- Brainstormed and generated idea for project
- Developed experimental design and created Python scripts to study axon geometry in individual neuron traces from
- Applied algorithm evaluating branching points on neuron traces and used branch angles to determine whether following trajectories would be continuation of main axon or axon branch. Applied method to 33 neuron traces. 
- Prepared poster on results
