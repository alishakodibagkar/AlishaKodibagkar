**Project Description:** Pulsatile tinnitus (PT) is a condition which affects over five million people in the US today. Despite PT being of auditory origin, there are no current devices that collect PT audio signatures for diagnosis. The goal of this project is to design a miniature ear canal microphone device that can pick up sounds within the frequency and amplitude range of PT sounds. A preliminary amplification circuit was created and tested for sensitivity, noise interference, and data output lag time. The device was successful, but in the future a smaller device will be needed. Future iterations were planned to use an electret microphone. Unfortunately, further development and testing with patients was discontinued due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
