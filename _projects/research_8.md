**Project Description:** Gene delivery to the brain is useful for the treatment of many neurological diseases, including brain tumors, Alzheimer’s, and Parkinson’s disease. In particular, non-viral gene vectors can be used to penetrate cells in the brain and deliver DNA in order to perform a therapeutic role, such as killing tumor cells.  Polyethylenimine (PEI) is one of the most effective cationic polymers used to compact DNA. However, high molecular weight PEI has high transfection efficacy, but is highly toxic to cells; conversely, low molecular weight PEI has low transfection efficacy and low cytotoxicity. Bioreducible cationic polymers are a potential solution, as they contain low molecular weight PEI linked together with disulfide bonds that break apart in the cell once they are separated from the DNA. The goal of this study is to look into the cytotoxicity and transfection efficacy of nanoparticles created with bioreducible cationic polymers in in-vitro transfection of cells, and to ensure that these particles are reproducible and stable in size and charge.
